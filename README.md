# FlowLogic Desktop App UI

**FlowLogic** is an educational desktop application designed to interactively teach machine learning concepts, specifically **Gradient Descent**. It provides a visual and interactive environment for users to understand optimization algorithms.

## Project Status
Currently, the project exists as a high-fidelity prototype using React and Vite. It includes:
- **Dashboard**: Overview of learning progress.
- **Visualization Panel**: Interactive graph for visualizing functions and gradient descent steps.
- **Learn & Quiz Modes**: Educational content and knowledge checks.

## Development Roadmap
We have planned a comprehensive update to transform this prototype into a fully functional application.
See [Implementation Plan](file:///C:/Users/Subham/.gemini/antigravity/brain/d0c1a1c8-0c42-4853-b3b2-10ba3d2fa392/implementation_plan.md) for details.

### Upcoming Features
- **Routing**: Full navigation support using `react-router-dom`.
- **Enhanced Graphing**: Moving to a robust charting library (Recharts/Visx).
- **Custom Functions**: Support for user-defined math functions.
- **Persistence**: Save progress and experiment history.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm (v9+)
